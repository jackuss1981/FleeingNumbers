# FleeingNumbers
repository for my creative coding project based on the wonderfull tutorials on Steering Behaviours ( https://youtu.be/4hA7G3gup-4 ) and programming a digital rain in the style of the Matrix ( https://youtu.be/S1TQCi9axzg ), created by Daniel Shiffman and Emily Xie respectively.

The idea was to merge the above tutorials in to one, so that the numbers fall down, until you move the mouse over it. Then the numbers 'flee' from the mouse.
