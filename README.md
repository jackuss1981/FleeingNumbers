# FleeingNumbers
repository for my creative coding project based on the wonderfull tutorials on Steering Behaviours ( https://youtu.be/4hA7G3gup-4 ) and programming a digital rain in the style of the Matrix ( https://youtu.be/S1TQCi9axzg ), created by Daniel Shiffman and Emily Xie respectively.

The idea is to combine the above tutorials in to one, so that numbers fall down, until you move the mouse or your finger over it. Then the numbers 'flee' from the mouse.

For a working example, see here http://coding.jackuss.nl/FleeingNumbers/index.html


TO DO:
  - Make it consume less memory.
  - Make some numbers lighter than others.
  - After the mouse is away, let all numbers go back in a nice row one behind the other.
